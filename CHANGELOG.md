# 3.0.0

Convert to ESM by default.

Transpile to ES2015.

CommonJS now uses `module.exports` rather than `exports.default`. This
allows for importing in CommonJS without requiring explicit `default`. e.g.

```js
// Previous:
const flattenChildren = require("react-keyed-flatten-children");
flattenChildren.default(children);
// Now:
const flattenChildren = require("react-keyed-flatten-children");
flattenChildren(children);
```
